	<li>The day started with questions on previous topics,and mam started new topic known as flow.</li>
  <li>I got the idea why we should use flow builder like screen flow and all instead of process builder, it is much more interactive and efficient to use.</li>
  <li>Then learnt about approvals and where it is used through some examples.</li>
  <li>Next topic was data security which seemed very interesting to me about how we can grant and control permissions for different profiles according to the hierarachy, excited to work on it.</li>
  <li>Then, finally got the assignments.</li>

    <h5 class="card-header">Salesforce training - 2nd March - 2022 </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
	<li> The day started with learning about different licenses and it's association with profiles.</li>
	<li> Then learned about different page layouts and we can design different layouts to cater different profiles,this topic felt easy to understand, will try to implement on my own.</li>
	<li>Tried to understand terms like compact layout, custom buttons, 1-2 confusion as well but I think when i will implement it will get cleared.</li>
	<li>Then comes Workflow a completely new topic for me, understood the workflow rule example of mam and the application seems very useful and interesting to me, actually i'm excited to write 2-3 rules by my own.</li>
  <li>But in next topic i.e. process builder i have lot of confusions, felt like we were rushed to understand so many processes in process builder in few very minutes, but i got the idea about how powerful process builder is as in one trigger or condition you can automate 3-4 processes like sending notification, mail etc. from salesforce, anyway I will try to practise on it and read few blogs on trailhead about this topic.</li>
	<li>Then we got the assignment, actually mam forgot to send the assignment 3 in last class so now we have to submit 3rd and 4th assignment both but mam gave the relaxation of attempting only half of the 4th assignment.</li>

    <h5 class="card-header">Salesforce training - 28 Feb - 2022 </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
	<li> The day started with few previous topics queries and question related with assignment.</li>
	<li> Next mam started teaching new concepts like relationships, types of relationships i.e lookup and master detail and the differences between it with examples.</li>
	<li> About validation rules in standard objects using formula field which present the users to fill invalid data in inputs.</li>
	<li> Then saw implementation of few functions like LookUp,IsBlank and isNew. Felt clueless at times in some topics like really what is going on.</li>
	<li> I'm able to understand the concepts but facing lot of difficulties while implementing as i'm still getting used to the salesforce platform.</li>
	<li> There are countless no of objects, fields, components on salesforce platfrom so i guess practising more and more is the only way to get good at it.</li>
	<li> At the end got loads of questions as an assignment, it is going to be difficult but I will give my 200%.</li>

	<li>The day started with the revision of last class topics as many of us had trouble in doing the assignment and finally learned how to create a new app properly. </li>
	<li> Then in that app how to make objects and within objects their respective fields.</li>
	<li>Learnt about different field types like picklist, formula, url and in picklist how to set dependencies.</li>
	<li>Mam showed how to use advanced formulas by giving 2-3 examples and i think need to do few more questions in order to understand this more.</li>
	<li>And then mam showed how to create a new app and inside the app we have different components like tab, objects, fields each having their own datatype and requirements.</li>
  <li>Saw how to display picture of an individual in contacts and i wasn't able to do it by myself, will try later in the day.</li>
  <li>Finally we got the assignment on creating a formula field and an app from scratch.</li>

	<li>Today I learnt about crm(customer relationship management) basics and why salesforce is so popular for it. And different types of cloud services like Saas, Paas and Iaas. </li>

	<li>Learnt to manage personal and company profile information.</li>
	<li>Also learnt terms like campaign, leads, opportunity which seemed quite easy for me understand in a general way.</li>
	<li>And then mam showed how to create a new app and inside the app we have different components like tab, objects, fields each having their own datatype and requirements.</li>
