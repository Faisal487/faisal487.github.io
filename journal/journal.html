	<li>Today I learnt about crm(customer relationship management) basics and why salesforce is so popular for it. And different types of cloud services like Saas, Paas and Iaas. </li>
	<li> I guess it will take some time to get familiar with salesforce platform and how to navigate through different tabs and components.</li>
	<li>Learnt to manage personal and company profile information.</li>
	<li>Also learnt terms like campaign, leads, opportunity which seemed quite easy for me understand in a general way.</li>
	<li>And then mam showed how to create a new app and inside the app we have different components like tab, objects, fields each having their own datatype and requirements.</li>
  <li>Got an assignment as well in which we have to create an app and i think it is going to be tough but i'll try my best.</li>
