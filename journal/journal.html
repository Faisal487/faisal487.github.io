    <p class="card-text">
    <li>We continued with the visual force and learned about standard controllers and how to make vf pages using URL.</li>
    <li>And how to utilise our custom vf pages into tabs and standard pages, then learned about standard list controllers.</li>
    <li>Different types of action tags like Action function,Action support,Action status, pollar and region and it's uses.</li>
    <li>At the end discussed about the project that we have to make using all the concepts that we have learned till now, and doubt classes regarding it.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
    <li>Day started with new topic Visual force pages which is used to build custom user interface.</li>
    <li>It is very similar to html containing tags nd all, saw how to create a basic visula force page.</li>
    <li>We can make vf pages interactive by adding logic using controllers.</li>
    <li>Next we saw how to display any object records in form of tables using vf pages and also how to relate two components using wrapper classes, at the end it got a little complicated but i'm confident that once i write the code on my own i would be able to understand it, hopefully.</li>
    <li>Topics are piling up now, also have to practise triggers a lot more as it is a crucial topic in apex.</li>
    <li>Will try to utilise the next 3 days to practise the above topics and also to relax a bit.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
    <li>Today we started with a new topic 'trigger' and understood it's importance in development.</li>
    <li>It can be classified on the basis of before and after actions, and also on the basis of insert, update, delete etc.</li>
    <li>Then we saw few examples of how to use triggers in different scenarios according to our needs.</li>
    <li>Some good practises and ideally we should write the whole logic of trigger in handlers and then import it into our main trigger code.</li>
    <li>Need to practise a lot of questions regarding this to have a good grasp over it.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
     <li>Installed java and ant for the purpose of learning DevOps for  Salesforce.</li>
     <li>Faced difficulty while setting path in environment variable due to different versions of java  but at the end was able to fix it by sir's help.</li>
     <li>Wrote couple of programs in java for the very first time, in terms of logic(loops,if-else) nd all it is same as C++ but yeah few syntax differences are there.</li>
     <li>It will take a bit of time for me to get used to it.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
   <li>Day started with mam showing how to delete records using soql.</li>
   <li>In today's sessions it was all about writing different queries using different keywords and operators according to the requirement.</li>
   <li>Learnt the difference between SOQL and SOSL, and ofcourse there is a need to practise a lot on these to have good command over it.</li>
   <li>Mam informed that assessment results are out, and at the end got loads of assignment and also we have start working on admin project.

    <p class="card-text">
    <li>Continuing with developer module mam explained super keyword, abstraction,interface and some examples of how to implement the methods of abstract class in child class.</li>
    <li>Then moved to collection datatypes like list, map and set.</li>
    <li>Then learnt about sObject datatype which is used to store records of different objects.</li>
    <li>Saw how to fetch record from salesforce objects using few sql queries and how we can insert many no of records in on go using lists.</li>
    <li>Atlast got the assignment and also a project regarding admin part.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
    <li>Day started with mam finishing the last topic of admin module i.e. chatter, it is similar to social media feeds.</li>
    <li>Then we dived into developer module which will be much more fun for me to learn.</li>
    <li>Mam briefed about apex and talked about variables, classes and objects, inheritance and all which seemed easy to grasp for me as i already knew about these things.</li>
    <li>However apex is much more similar to java than c++ as i noticed there were few changes in syntax while inheriting and overriding, i guess i have to practise a bit on it(as i come from c++) to get used to the minor changes in the syntax.</li>
    <li>Overall enjoyed the session and is much more fun to learn as compare to admin part.</li>

    <h5 class="card-header">Salesforce Training - 4th March - 2022_DAY 6 </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
	<li>Day started with discussion with mam on the no of questions in assignments, it is too many and how instead of understanding the concepts we are more concerned about submitting the assignment on time, and mam agreed with us.</li>
	<li>Then mam asked few question regarding the previous class as usual.</li>
	<li>Learnt about import wizard and dataloader and how we can import and export objects data in the form of csv file from salesforce.</li>
	<li>Next topic was queue and lead assignment.</li>
	<li>Then we moved onto reports and dashboard which seemed very interesting to me that when we have huge amount of data so it becomes difficult to get clear insight and patterns of the data but with the help of charts, different types of tables and dashboard we get the idea about the data in just few minutes.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
	<li>The day started with questions on previous topics,and mam started new topic known as flow.</li>
  <li>I got the idea why we should use flow builder like screen flow and all instead of process builder, it is much more interactive and efficient to use.</li>
  <li>Then learnt about approvals and where it is used through some examples.</li>
  <li>Next topic was data security which seemed very interesting to me about how we can grant and control permissions for different profiles according to the hierarachy, excited to work on it.</li>
  <li>Then, finally got the assignments.</li>

    <h5 class="card-header">Salesforce training - 2nd March - 2022 </h5>
    <p class="card-text">
	<li> The day started with learning about different licenses and it's association with profiles.</li>
	<li> Then learned about different page layouts and we can design different layouts to cater different profiles,this topic felt easy to understand, will try to implement on my own.</li>
	<li>Tried to understand terms like compact layout, custom buttons, 1-2 confusion as well but I think when i will implement it will get cleared.</li>
	<li>Then comes Workflow a completely new topic for me, understood the workflow rule example of mam and the application seems very useful and interesting to me, actually i'm excited to write 2-3 rules by my own.</li>
  <li>But in next topic i.e. process builder i have lot of confusions, felt like we were rushed to understand so many processes in process builder in few very minutes, but i got the idea about how powerful process builder is as in one trigger or condition you can automate 3-4 processes like sending notification, mail etc. from salesforce, anyway I will try to practise on it and read few blogs on trailhead about this topic.</li>
	<li>Then we got the assignment, actually mam forgot to send the assignment 3 in last class so now we have to submit 3rd and 4th assignment both but mam gave the relaxation of attempting only half of the 4th assignment.</li>

    <p class="card-text">
	<li> The day started with few previous topics queries and question related with assignment.</li>
	<li> Next mam started teaching new concepts like relationships, types of relationships i.e lookup and master detail and the differences between it with examples.</li>
	<li> About validation rules in standard objects using formula field which present the users to fill invalid data in inputs.</li>
	<li> Then saw implementation of few functions like LookUp,IsBlank and isNew. Felt clueless at times in some topics like really what is going on.</li>
	<li> I'm able to understand the concepts but facing lot of difficulties while implementing as i'm still getting used to the salesforce platform.</li>
	<li> There are countless no of objects, fields, components on salesforce platfrom so i guess practising more and more is the only way to get good at it.</li>
	<li> At the end got loads of questions as an assignment, it is going to be difficult but I will give my 200%.</li>

	<li>The day started with the revision of last class topics as many of us had trouble in doing the assignment and finally learned how to create a new app properly. </li>
	<li> Then in that app how to make objects and within objects their respective fields.</li>
	<li>Learnt about different field types like picklist, formula, url and in picklist how to set dependencies.</li>
	<li>Mam showed how to use advanced formulas by giving 2-3 examples and i think need to do few more questions in order to understand this more.</li>
	<li>And then mam showed how to create a new app and inside the app we have different components like tab, objects, fields each having their own datatype and requirements.</li>
  <li>Saw how to display picture of an individual in contacts and i wasn't able to do it by myself, will try later in the day.</li>
  <li>Finally we got the assignment on creating a formula field and an app from scratch.</li>

	<li>Today I learnt about crm(customer relationship management) basics and why salesforce is so popular for it. And different types of cloud services like Saas, Paas and Iaas. </li>

	<li>Learnt to manage personal and company profile information.</li>
	<li>Also learnt terms like campaign, leads, opportunity which seemed quite easy for me understand in a general way.</li>
